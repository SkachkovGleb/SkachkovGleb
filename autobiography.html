        <h1>My life before Haaga-Helia</h1>

        

        <h3>My childhood</h3>
        <p class="intro">
            Howdy! My name is Gleb and I've been stumbling through life since 1990. 
            Born in Leningrad, now St. Petersburg, I had to move all over the russia and beyond.
            I've spent my childhood in Kazakhstan, Siberia, a military base under moscow, Norway 
            and finally, when i was 13, my wondering ended, when my mother settled down in Finnland, Helsinki.
            Moving around had it's benefits and had it's downsides, but in the end I'm happy with where I ended up. 
        
    </p>
        <h3>Life in Finland</h3>
        <p class="intro">
            My adaptation was hard at the start. With no Finnish language, a social circle filled with other Russian speakers
            and a rebellious attitude, made things hard for myself. However, with time my life branched out and within a few 
            years, I was on my way to becoming a nurse.
    </p>
        <h3>Study and Work life</h3>
        <p class="intro">
            Nursing school was alot of fun, where I made quite a few friends and in 2010, I was already working in elderly care.
            From there on, I was drifting from occupation to occupation. From elderly care to rehab and psych wards. 
            For five years  was working in the healthcare field, but at some point I felt overburdened and took a year, to complete my 
            <a href="army.html">army service</a>, where I met my wife. After the army was done, I continued my career as a nurse.
            While working in the Suursuo Hospital, I got familiarized with python and stumbled myself into being the responsible for the
            IT side of things, which was mainly me teaching my colleagues to use Outlook and making PowerPoint presentations on for the 
            relatives. This was the spark, that ignited my interest in the technological sides of things. After a while, my resolve grew
            and I applied to Haaga-Helia, to the get my degree in Business Information Technology and possibly combine it with my expertise
            in the healthcare.

        </p>
        <h3>Hopes and dreams</h3>
        <p class="intro">
            Now I slowly, but surely make my way towards my goal. While I might be overwhelmed and tired, I love every moment of it.
            Hopefully my study will go smoothly and a world of possibilities await me.
        </p>
